Imagine you are exploring a forest, and each tree branch represents a line of thought.

Rather than making big leaps to far branches, focus on making small, careful moves to neighboring branches, staying close to where you just were.

At each step, pick the next logical or incremental option — refining your position bit by bit. Think locally, not globally.
