At each step, instead of thinking locally or making small incremental moves, 
please consider **making big leaps** in your reasoning.

Specifically:
- Try to **connect concepts or numbers that seem far apart**.
- Prefer **longer-range combinations** over adjacent or local steps.
- Avoid step-by-step greedy solutions; instead, make bold jumps even if they look less obvious at first.
- You do not need to go in numerical or structural order.
- Think in terms of "maximum novelty".

Your need to maximize the diversity and distance between steps in your reasoning path.
