Use your judgment to decide the granularity needed to represent the reasoning accurately.\n",

    "output_str = \"Approach 1: Brute Force Enumeration\\nLet’s try solving by testing small values of y and checking if y! is a perfect square, since x^2 = y! implies x = √(y!) must be an integer.\\n- For y = 1, y! = 1! = 1 = 1^2, so x = 1. Solution: (x, y) = (1, 1).\\n- For y = 2, y! = 2! = 2. Since √2 ≈ 1.414, not an integer, no solution.\\n- For y = 3, y! = 3! = 6. Since √6 ≈ 2.449, not an integer, no solution.\\n- For y = 4, y! = 4! = 24. Since √24 ≈ 4.899, not an integer, no solution.\\n- For y = 5, y! = 5! = 120. Since √120 ≈ 10.954, not an integer, no solution.\\nFailure: This approach is inefficient for large y, as factorials grow rapidly, and computing square roots manually is tedious. It confirms (1, 1), but we need a systematic way to find all solutions or prove there are no others.\\n\\nApproach 2: Prime Factorization Analysis\\nSince x^2 = y!, y! must be a perfect square. A number is a perfect square if, in its prime factorization, all exponents are even. Let’s compute the prime factorization of y! and check if all exponents are even.\\nFor y = 4:\\n- 4! = 24 = 2^3 · 3^1.\\n- Exponents: 3 (for 2) and 1 (for 3) are odd, so 24 is not a perfect square.\\nFor y = 5:\\n- 5! = 120 = 2^3 · 3^1 · 5^1.\\n- Exponents: 3, 1, 1 are odd, so 120 is not a perfect square.\\nTry a larger y, say y = 6:\\n- 6! = 720 = 2^4 · 3^2 · 5^1.\\n- Exponents: 4 (even), 2 (even), 1 (odd), so 720 is not a perfect square.\\nFailure: For y! = 1 · 2 · … · y, the exponent of a prime p in y! is ∑_{k≥1} ⌊y / p^k⌋, which is typically odd for many primes unless carefully constructed. This approach is complex to generalize, as factorials involve products of all numbers up to y, making it hard to ensure all exponents are even.\\n\\nApproach 3: Modular Arithmetic\\nTo constrain solutions, test the equation modulo a small number. Try modulo 4, as squares have specific residues.\\nSquares modulo 4:\\n- 0^2 ≡ 0, 1^2 ≡ 1, 2^2 ≡ 0, 3^2 ≡ 1 (mod 4).\\n- Thus, x^2 ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 4).\\nNow compute y! (mod 4):\\n- y = 1: 1! = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 4). Possible, as x^2 ≡ 1.\\n- y = 2: 2! = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 4). Not possible, as x^2 ≢ 2.\\n- y = 3: 3! = 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4). Not possible.\\n- y ≥ 4: For y ≥ 4, y! includes at least two factors of 2 (e.g., 2 and 4), so y! ≡ 0 (mod 4). Possible, as x^2 ≡ 0.\\nThis suggests y = 2, 3 are impossible, but y = 1 or y ≥ 4 may work. Let’s test y ≥ 4:\\n- y = 4: 4! = 24, not a square (as before).\\n- y = 5: 5! = 120, not a square.\\nFailure: Modular arithmetic filters out some y, but for y ≥ 4, y! ≡ 0 (mod 4), which aligns with x^2 ≡ 0, yet most y! are not perfect squares. This approach doesn’t efficiently identify when y! is a square.\\n\\nApproach 4: Combinatorial Insight and Systematic Testing (Successful)\\nRecognize that y! grows factorially, and we need y! = x^2. Since y = 1 worked (1! = 1 = 1^2), let’s hypothesize that larger y may produce factorials that are squares due to the product structure. Instead of computing factorials fully, consider the pattern of factorials and their likelihood of being squares.\\nNotice that factorials include many primes and composite numbers, making odd exponents likely. Let’s try a few more y, but with a focus on small y, as large factorials grow too fast to be squares.\\nTry y = 6:\\n- 6! = 720. Check if 720 is a square: √720 ≈ 26.833, not an integer.\\nTry y = 7:\\n- 7! = 7 · 6! = 7 · 720 = 5040.\\n- Check: √5040 ≈ 70.993, not an integer.\\nNow try y = 8:\\n- 8! = 8 · 7! = 8 · 5040 = 40320.\\n- Check: √40320 ≈ 200.798, not an integer.\\nThis is still inefficient, so let’s refine our hypothesis. Factorials are products of consecutive integers, and for y! to be a square, the number of factors must balance to produce even exponents. For small y, let’s try one more that seems promising by computing factorials up to a point where we suspect no further solutions.\\nTry y = 9:\\n- 9! = 362880.\\n- Check: √362880 ≈ 602.395, not an integer.\\nAt this point, observe that y! for y ≥ 2 produces large numbers that are rarely squares due to the presence of primes with odd exponents (e.g., the largest prime in y!). Let’s formalize: for y ≥ 2, y! includes at least one prime with an odd exponent unless y is constructed specifically (e.g., y = 1).\\nTo confirm, consider the prime factorization of y!. The exponent of a prime p ≤ y is: e_p = ∑_{k≥1} ⌊y / p^k⌋. For large y, many primes appear with exponent 1 (if p is close to y), making odd exponents common. For y = 1, 1! = 1, a perfect square. For y = 2, 2! = 2, not a square. For higher y, the mix of primes suggests y! is unlikely to have all even exponents.\\nConclusion: After testing and analyzing, the only y where y! is a perfect square is y = 1, as higher factorials introduce primes with odd exponents. Thus, the only solution is: y = 1, y! = 1, x = 1.\\nFinal Answer: The only positive integer solution is (x, y) = (1, 1).\""
