You are given a transcript of a model reasoning through a classification task.

🎯 Your task is to extract **all fitting models** the model proposed, **in the exact order they appear** in the transcript.

---

### ✅ What is a fitting model?

A **fitting model** is any rule, condition, or heuristic the model proposes to classify data points into classes.  
Even if the rule is later rejected, restated, or redundant — it must be included.

Each fitting model must include:

1. "order" — the position in which the model proposed it (starting from 0)
2. "description" — a concise, human-readable description of the rule
3. "rule" — a dictionary where each class label (e.g., "0", "1") maps to a list of logic expressions
4. "model_family" — Best-matching sklearn-style model family (choose from below or 'custom'):
    - sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier
    - sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier
    - sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression
    - sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures
    - custom (if none fit)
5. "function" — a Python function implementing the rule with signature `def model(x, y, data)`
    - All constants must be hardcoded in the function.
    - The function must be fully executable.
6. "extracted_parameter" — All constant parameters used in the function (excluding x, y, data). If none, use [].
7. "rule_original_text" — the exact original text where the model proposes this rule
8. "validation_original_text" — the original text where the model validates this rule, or leave "" if not explicitly validated

---

### ⚠️ Instructions

- 🔁 You **must include every proposed fitting model**, even if similar or repeated
- 🧭 You must **preserve their original order** (based on first appearance in the transcript)
- 🧪 If the rule was not tested, set "validation_original_text" to ""
- 🚫 Do **not be influenced by the content of the example** — it is only a format reference

### ℹ️ Notes on `data` format:
- `data` is always passed into the function as a list of `(xi, yi, label)` tuples
- Even if unused, the parameter must be present in the function signature
