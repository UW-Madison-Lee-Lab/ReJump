You are given:
1. The original input (question or data).
2. A complete chain-of-thought reasoning trace from a model.

Your goal is to extract every step as a node in a directed graph, with the following requirements. **Output every node** in the chain; do not omit any.

## 1. Node Schema

Each node must be an object with these fields:
- **id** (integer): The position of the step in the chain, starting from 0.
- **text** (string): The exact text of that reasoning step or premise.
- **depends_on** (array of integers or null): The `id`(s) of the node(s) this step directly uses as input. Dependencies must faithfully reflect the original chain-of-thought. If a node has no dependencies, set this field to `null`.
- **type** (string): one of the following categories:
  - `Observation` (direct observations, data listings, inferences, or result aggregation)
  - `Hypothesis`  (rule tests, pattern guesses, or method/strategy decisions;  
      - may include an optional `points_to` field when semantically identical to an earlier Hypothesis;  
      - **may have no dependencies** (`depends_on: null`) if the hypothesis is posed without any stated basis;  
      - **should list dependencies** when the hypothesis is explicitly based on prior Observations or input facts.)
  - `Validation`  (execution or checking of a chosen method; must depend on at least one `Hypothesis` node, because Validation nodes verify whether a Hypothesis is correct; may also depend on Observation nodes)
  - `Conclusion`  (final answer)

**Additional fields for Observation nodes only:**
- **is_hallucinated** (boolean): `true` if this Observation introduces content not present in the input or any prior nodes; otherwise `false`.
- **origin** (object):
  - **source** (string): `"input"` if the fact comes directly from the original input, or `"inferred"` if it is derived from prior nodes.
  - **inferred_from** (array of integers, optional): list of `id`(s) of the node(s) from which this observation was inferred. Include this field only if `"source"` is `"inferred"`.

> **Important:**
> - Only `Observation` nodes may include `"is_hallucinated"` and `"origin"`.
> - All other node types must **not** include these fields.
> - A `Hypothesis` node may include:
>   - **points_to** (integer): the `id` of an earlier `Hypothesis` node if this step is semantically identical to that prior Hypothesis.
> - Each `Validation` node's `depends_on` must include at least one `Hypothesis` node to reflect that it verifies a specific Hypothesis.
> - **Hypothesis** nodes may sometimes have **no** dependencies (set `"depends_on": null`); otherwise, list the `id`(s) of the Observation or input-based nodes that provided the reasoning for that hypothesis.

## 2. Output Format

Return **only** a single JSON object with a top-level key `"nodes"`, whose value is an array of node objects:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "text": "<first reasoning step text>",
      "depends_on": null,
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": { "source": "input" }
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "<second reasoning step text>",
      "depends_on": null,
      "type": "Hypothesis"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "<third reasoning step text>",
      "depends_on": [1],
      "type": "Validation"
    },
    {
      "id": N,
      "text": "<final reasoning step text>",
      "depends_on": [M],
      "type": "Conclusion"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Do **not** wrap the JSON in markdown or add extra commentary.
- Preserve the exact text of each step in `text`.
- Keep nodes in the order they appear.

## 3. Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** “What is 2 + 3?”

```
Model Step 1: “I will compute the sum.”
Model Step 2: “The numbers are 2 and 3.”
Model Step 3: “Sum = 5.”
Model Step 4: “Therefore, the result is 5.”
```

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "text": "I will compute the sum.",
      "depends_on": null,
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": { "source": "input" }
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "Sum = 5.",
      "depends_on": [0],
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": {
        "source": "inferred",
        "inferred_from": [0]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Therefore, the result is 5.",
      "depends_on": [1],
      "type": "Conclusion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Repeated Hypothesis

**Input:** “Is 8 even?”

```
Model Step 1: “The number given is 8.”
Model Step 2: “A number divisible by 2 has remainder 0.”
Model Step 3: “8 mod 2 equals 0.”
Model Step 4: “Since remainder is 0, 8 is even.”
Model Step 5: “8 mod 2 equals 0.”  // same as Step 3
Model Step 6: “Thus, 8 is even.”
```

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "text": "The number given is 8.",
      "depends_on": null,
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": { "source": "input" }
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "A number divisible by 2 has remainder 0.",
      "depends_on": [0],
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": {
        "source": "inferred",
        "inferred_from": [0]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "8 mod 2 equals 0.",
      "depends_on": [0],
      "type": "Hypothesis"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "Since remainder is 0, 8 is even.",
      "depends_on": [2,1],
      "type": "Validation"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "text": "8 mod 2 equals 0.",
      "depends_on": [0],
      "type": "Hypothesis",
      "points_to": 2
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "text": "Thus, 8 is even.",
      "depends_on": [3],
      "type": "Conclusion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Hypothesis without dependencies

**Input:** “Is 7 prime?”

```
Model Step 1: “I will determine if a number is prime.”
Model Step 2: “I assume n is prime.”  // No justification given
Model Step 3: “Check divisibility: 7 mod 2 != 0.”
Model Step 4: “Thus, 7 is prime.”
```

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "text": "I will determine if a number is prime.",
      "depends_on": null,
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": { "source": "input" }
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "I assume n is prime.",
      "depends_on": null,
      "type": "Hypothesis"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Check divisibility: 7 mod 2 != 0.",
      "depends_on": [1],
      "type": "Validation"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "Thus, 7 is prime.",
      "depends_on": [2],
      "type": "Conclusion"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 4: Explicit vs. baseless Hypothesis

**Input:** “Classify points based on their positions.”

```
Model Step 1: “Point A is at (7.104, -5.1).”
Model Step 2: “Point B is at (5.137, -8.6).”
Model Step 3: “Alternatively, maybe it's a diagonal classifier?”  // no basis given
Model Step 4: “Point A has x1=7.104 > |x2|=5.1, Point B has x1=5.137 < |x2|=8.6.”
Model Step 5: “So perhaps classify as 1 when x1 > |x2|, else 0.”
Model Step 6: “Thus, A→1, B→0.”
```

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "text": "Point A is at (7.104, -5.1).",
      "depends_on": null,
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": { "source": "input" }
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "Point B is at (5.137, -8.6).",
      "depends_on": [0],
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": { "source": "input" }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Alternatively, maybe it's a diagonal classifier?",
      "depends_on": null,
      "type": "Hypothesis"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "Point A has x1=7.104 > |x2|=5.1, Point B has x1=5.137 < |x2|=8.6.",
      "depends_on": [0,1],
      "type": "Observation",
      "is_hallucinated": false,
      "origin": { "source": "inferred", "inferred_from": [0,1] }
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "text": "So perhaps classify as 1 when x1 > |x2|, else 0.",
      "depends_on": [3],
      "type": "Hypothesis"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "text": "Thus, A→1, B→0.",
      "depends_on": [4],
      "type": "Conclusion"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now apply this process to the provided input and reasoning trace, and output the JSON.
