You are given:
1. A complete chain-of-thought reasoning trace from a model, pre-processed into numbered lines. Each line starts with its index (0, 1, 2, ...) followed by a period and a space, like `"{index}. {reasoning step text}"`. Each numbered line represents a single node in the reasoning graph.

Your goal is to extract the graph structure from this reasoning trace. **Output every node** indicated by a numbered line; do not omit any.

## 1. Node Schema

Each node must be an object with these fields:
- **id** (integer): The index number provided at the beginning of the corresponding input line. This must match the input numbering exactly.
- **depends_on** (array of integers or null): The `id`(s) (i.e., the index numbers from the input) of the node(s) this step directly uses as input. Dependencies must faithfully reflect the original chain-of-thought. If a node has no dependencies, set this field to `null`. You need to infer these dependencies by analyzing the content and flow of the reasoning across the numbered lines.
- **type** (string): one of the following categories, determined by analyzing the content of the corresponding input line:
  - `Observation` (direct observations, data listings, inferences, or result aggregation)
  - `Hypothesis` (rule tests, pattern guesses, or method/strategy decisions;
    - may include an optional `points_to` field when semantically identical to an earlier Hypothesis;
    - **may have no dependencies** (`depends_on: null`) if the hypothesis is posed without any stated basis;
    - **should list dependencies** when the hypothesis is explicitly based on prior Observations or input facts.)
  - `Validation` (execution or checking of a chosen method; must depend on at least one `Hypothesis` node, because Validation nodes verify whether a Hypothesis is correct; may also depend on Observation nodes)
  - `Conclusion` (final answer or summary statement derived from the preceding steps)

**Additional fields for Observation nodes only:**
- **is_hallucinated** (boolean): `true` if this Observation introduces content not present in the input or any prior nodes (identified by their `id`); otherwise `false`. This requires analyzing the content of the numbered line relative to previous lines.
- **origin** (object):
  - **source** (string): `"input"` if the fact comes directly from the original input implicitly referenced by the step, or `"inferred"` if it is derived from prior nodes.
  - **inferred_from** (array of integers, optional): list of `id`(s) of the node(s) from which this observation was inferred. Include this field only if `"source"` is `"inferred"`.

> **Important:**
> - Only `Observation` nodes may include `"is_hallucinated"` and `"origin"`.
> - All other node types must **not** include these fields.
> - A `Hypothesis` node may include:
>   - **points_to** (integer): the `id` of an earlier `Hypothesis` node if this step is semantically identical to that prior Hypothesis.
> - Each `Validation` node's `depends_on` must include at least one `Hypothesis` node `id` to reflect that it verifies a specific Hypothesis.
> - **Hypothesis** nodes may sometimes have **no** dependencies (set `"depends_on": null`); otherwise, list the `id`(s) of the Observation or input-based nodes that provided the reasoning for that hypothesis.
> - The `text` of the reasoning step is **not** included in the output node object.

## 2. Output Format

Return **only** a single JSON object with a top-level key `"nodes"`, whose value is an array of node objects following the schema above:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "depends_on": <dependencies_for_node_0>,
      "type": "<type_of_node_0>"
      // ... other fields based on type
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "depends_on": <dependencies_for_node_1>,
      "type": "<type_of_node_1>"
      // ... other fields based on type
    },
    // ... more nodes
    {
      "id": N,
      "depends_on": <dependencies_for_node_N>,
      "type": "<type_of_node_N>"
      // ... other fields based on type
    }
  ]
}
```
