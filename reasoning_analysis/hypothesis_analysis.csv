35,"Alternatively, maybe if x1 is more negative than x2. For [-7.937, -4.357], x1=-7.9, x2=-4.3 →x1 is more negative (since -7.9 < -4.3). So |x1| > |x2|. For [-4.078, -8.878], |x1| is 4.07, |x2|=8.87 → |x1| < |x2|. So label 0. So maybe in the negative x1 and x2 region, if |x1| > |x2|, label 1, else 0. Let's check:",0,0,1,2,1,0

46,"Another idea: maybe the labels are based on whether the point is inside or outside of certain polygons or regions.
